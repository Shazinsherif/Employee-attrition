Project: Employee Attrition Prediction

The objective of this project is to analyze employee data to predict the likelihood of attrition (i.e., employees leaving the company). By identifying factors contributing to attrition, HR departments can take proactive measures to retain valuable employees and improve overall employee satisfaction.

For this project, we'll use the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, which contains various features about employees such as age, job role, work environment satisfaction, and whether they've left the company or not
